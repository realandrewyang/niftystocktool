# niftystocktool
The Nifty Stock Tool uses fast, real-time financial data to provide insight and recommendations in stock trading. Please be patient as our website is currently under construction. You can check on the status [here](https://realandrewyang.github.io/niftystocktool).

We are proud to be using [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co), a free stock data API.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please contact [Andrew Yang](https://realandrewyang.github.io).
